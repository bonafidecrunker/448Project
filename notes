things we need:
- all connected 4-vertex graphs
- all 4-vertex leaf powers (i.e., for n.d.k files, all i.j.4 files)
  - function that finds all graphs of connections by computing powers of a graph until a clique is reached
  - max possible number for x in Gx is going to be j or j - 1
  - look for networkx all pairs shortest path
    - go through all pairs of leaves and computer their shortest path
  - ideally, the only ones that do not match between the two lists of files will be the ones that have C4'2
